# E-Retail

E-Retail is an e-commerce application that acts as an online store where you can buy things from a list of products.

## Tech Stack

Frontend - React.js (v17)  
Backend - Django (v3.2)  
Database - Postgresql (v13)

## Installation

The project folders are divided into three sections namely:

- e-retail-frontend
- e-retail-backend
- docs

As the name suggests, the respective folders contain the relevant frontend and backend code files.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install e-retail-backend using the requirements.txt file in the backend folder. Traverse into the e-retail-backend folder and use the following command to install the backend:

```terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the installation is done, traverse into the e-retail folder inside e-retail-backend and run the backend application using the following command:

```terminal
python manage.py runserver
```

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install e-retail-frontend using the requirements.txt file in the backend folder. Traverse into the e-retail-frontend folder and use the following command to install the backend:

```terminal
npm install
```

Once the installation has finished installation, run the following command to run your frontend application:

```bash
npm start
```
